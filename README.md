 OOP Game Show - Video Game/Super Mario Edition


The player tries to guess the a random character on each turn. The player has 5 guesses and if they guess correctly, they win! However, each time the player misses a character/phrase they lose a life. If the player misses 5 times (loses 5 lives), the game is over. My version is inspired by Super Mario, as I was a huge fan growing up, and it was one of the first games I recall playing as a kid.

Some style changes were made to the CSS in regards to background color and a fade effect was applied for when the game starts up, there is some transitioning that takes place there. I tried to choose colors that would remind the player of Super Mario while they were guessing the characters/phrases.
